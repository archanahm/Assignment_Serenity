Added belwo dependencies in build.gradle file 

dependencies {

    compile('com.google.guava:guava:22.0'){
        force = true
    }
    
Reason : there was exception while using other guava version (copatabality issue)hence added guava 22.0 as force use.
Exception in thread "Thread-4" java.lang.IllegalAccessError:tried to access method com.google.common.util.concurrent.SimpleTimeLimiter

Thanks
Archana
